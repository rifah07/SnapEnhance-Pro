## ðŸš€ Project Overview
SnapEnhance is a cloud-native, AI-powered image processing web application that combines machine learning, containerization, and CI/CD automation to deliver real-time image transformation features. Users can upload images and apply AI-based effects through a seamless and scalable interface.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Cloud:** Render (Backend), Vercel (Frontend)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Goals
- **Cloud-Native & Scalable Architecture**
  - Fully deployed on cloud (Render & Vercel)
  - Uses free-tier services
  - Dockerized for consistent deployment
- **AI-Based Image Processing**
  - Features: Grayscale, edge detection, background removal
  - Optimized for real-time performance
- **CI/CD Automation**
  - GitHub Actions handles testing and deployment
  - Backend & frontend deployed automatically on code changes
- **User-Friendly Interface**
  - Clean HTML/CSS/JS frontend
  - Upload, progress indicator, image download functionality
- **Security & Reliability**
  - Environment variables for secret keys
  - Basic authentication for account-based access

## ðŸ“Œ Implementation Plan
1. **Backend API with Flask**
   - Image upload, user auth, image processing features
2. **Dockerize Backend**
   - Build, run, and manage containers
3. **Deploy Backend on Render**
   - Host and expose API endpoints
4. **Frontend Development**
   - User interface to interact with the API
5. **Dockerize Frontend**
   - Package for deployment
6. **Deploy Frontend on Vercel**
7. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
   - Automate builds and deployment
